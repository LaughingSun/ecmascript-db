# ecmascript-db
ECMAScript class, method &amp; function spec lookup database project

Wantering through some of the more obscure areas of http://developer.apple.com, http://developer.mozilla.org, http://docs.webplatform.org and other sites for information can be time consuming and a real headache if you cannot find what you are looking for.  

Ever need to find methods that return specific instances of something?

Imagine you can not only look up the properties, constructor and methods of a class but you could also lookup the methods of a class or any class return instances of a class.  

Imagine you could easily search all reputable ecmascript specification documents and sites for information on properties, constructor and methods of a class and return values.

Image you could do all of the above and further filter or compare platforms and versions.

Imagine no longer, but EXPERIENCE it now!

This project datamines specifications and documents on the web and tests their accuaracy on all platforms it knows about: building an excellent database for spec information and implementing the ability to filter the search results.

Go to http://laughingsun.github.io/ecmascript-db for a nightly developer version of the site.  A production beta site will be up soon with funding (fingers crossed.)

Oh yeah, we have arrived!

* your will notice that w3schools, wikipedia and stackoverflow are NOT listed above because they suck for authoritative and tested information.  Yeah they have their place in the world and are helpful under many circumstances, but they have too many errors and misinformation, and not enough context for development reference.
